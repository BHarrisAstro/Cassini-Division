About:
-MimasODE defines an ordinary differential equation calculating a new position and velocity for Mimas using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. 

-ParticlesODE defines an ordinary differential equation calculating new positions and velocities for all particles in the ring system based on the net gravitational attraction between Mimas and Saturn. 

-Initializes the system with nParticles number of ring particles randomly placed within a ring surrounding Saturn. The radius of the ring is defined by the innermost bounds of the B ring and the outermost bounds of the A ring. Mimas is positioned outside of the ring system.
